<!--The reindeer were about the size of Shetland ponies and their hair was so white that even the snow hardly looked white compared with them; 
    their branching horns were gilded and shone like something on fire when the sunrise caught them. 
    Their harness was of scarlet leather and covered with bells. 
    On the sledge, driving the reindeer, sat a fat dwarf who would have been about three feet high if he had been standing.
     He was dressed in polar bear’s fur and on his head he wore a red hood with a long gold tassel hanging down from its point;
      his huge beard covered his knees and served him instead of a rug.
       But behind him, on a much higher seat in the middle of the sledge sat a very different person — a great lady, taller than any woman that Edmund had ever seen. 
       She also was covered in white fur up to her throat and held a long straight golden wand in her right hand and wore a golden crown on her head. 
       Her face was white — not merely pale, but white like snow or paper or icing-sugar, except for her very red mouth. 
       It was a beautiful face in other respects, but proud and cold and stern. 
    The sledge was a fine sight as it came sweeping towards Edmund with the bells jingling and the dwarf cracking his whip and the snow flying up on each side of it.
